# roam-theme-zenith-nord
A Nord modification of the Zenith theme for Roam Research.

The Zenith theme is from [Azlen Elza](https://github.com/azlen). The color palette is taken from [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes).

If you like this theme, consider donating to [Azlen](https://www.paypal.me/azlenelza). Azlen did all the real work; I just changed some colors and fonts.
